This is an E-Commerce website which speciaizes in selling electronic products for all  category. The website provides 33,000 products of different types of products like mobiles, laptops, cameras, etc.

In this project I have tried to manipulate dom elements using REACT with CHAKRA UI Library, styling using css in react and tried to make website more dynamic and responsive. With the self learning efforts and the technology stack, that I have learned till Unit-4 in the Masai School, I was able to clone the whole website with same looking & features.


# Technology Stack Used 🌟
* REACT
* CHAKRA UI Library
* react-router-dom library
* axios library
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

For storing user data we also used localStorage , JSON-Server.

## How to run the Project
* Open pages directory.
* Open index.html using live server command 'npm run server'.

## End Notes 📑
In this project I have tried to achieve a near to perfect clone of the original website images provided as much as possible. This entire journey of this construct week has given me experiences and I have learned lots of things by applying to the real website and it gave me a lot of confidence. Most of the features are added and functionality of the website is achieved.

## Limitations
Cart Page need to have more work over it due to time constraints.
