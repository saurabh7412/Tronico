This is an E-Commerce website which speciaizes in selling electronic products for all  category. The website provides 33,000 products of different types products like mobiles, laptops, cameras, etc.

In this project I have tried to manipulate dom elements using REACT , styling using css in react and tried to make website more dynamic and responsive. With the self learning efforts and the technology stack, that I have learned till Unit-4 in the Masai School, I was able to clone the whole website with same looking & features.


# Technology Stack Used ðŸŒŸ
* REACT
* CHAKRA UI Library
* react-router-dom library
* axios library
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

For storing user data we also used localStorage , JSON-Server.

## How to run the Project
* Open pages directory.
* Open index.html using live server command 'npm run server'.

## End Notes ðŸ“‘
In this project I have tried to achieve a near to perfect clone of the original website images provided as much as possible. This entire journey of this construct week has given me experiences and I have learned lots of things by applying to the real website and it gave me a lot of confidence. Most of the features are added and functionality of the website is achieved.

## Limitations
Cart Page need to have more work over it due to time constraints.
